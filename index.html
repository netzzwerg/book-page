				<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. As you wish. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

				<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>

				<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny
				golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
				locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
				time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen
				inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>

				<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down
				and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and
				wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though
				the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my
				shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ For, you
				see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were
				really impossible.</p>

				<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
				another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
				bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label,
				with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>

				<p>It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. ‘No,
				I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little
				histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
				<em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you
				if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she
				had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you,
				sooner or later.</p>

				<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it
				had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
				toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>

				<p>‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’</p>

				<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now
				the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes
				to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said
				Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to
				fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen
				such a thing.</p>

				<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor
				Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table
				for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
				best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,
				the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>

				<p>‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this
				minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded
				herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
				cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of
				pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s
				hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em> respectable person!’</p>

				<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small
				cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it
				makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way
				I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’</p>

				<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her
				head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure,
				this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but
				out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>

				<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
