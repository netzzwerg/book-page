					<h1>Patternity, Proto-Patterns <span class="amp">&amp;</span> The Rule Of Three</h1>
				</header>

				<p>Remember that not every algorithm, best practice or solution represents what might be considered a complete pattern. There may be a few key ingredients here that are missing and the pattern community is generally wary of something claiming to be one unless it has been heavily vetted. Even if something is presented to us which <strong>appears</strong> to meet the criteria for a pattern, it should not be considered one until it has undergone suitable periods of scrutiny and testing by others.</p>

				<p>Looking back upon the work by Alexander once more, he claims that a pattern should both be a process and a "thing". This definition is obtuse on purpose as he follows by saying that it is the process which should create the "thing". This is a reason why patterns generally focus on addressing a visually identifiable structure i.e we should be able to visually depict (or draw) a picture representing the structure that placing the pattern into practice results in.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, the individual(s) sharing the pattern may not have the time or interest of going through the "pattern"-ity process and might release a short description of their proto-pattern instead. Brief descriptions or snippets of this type of pattern are known as patlets.</p>

				<p>The work involved in fully documenting a qualified pattern can be quite daunting. Looking back at some of the earliest work in the field of design patterns, a pattern may be considered "good" if it does the following:</p>

				<ul type="disc">
					<li><strong>Solves a particular problem</strong>: Patterns are not supposed to just capture principles or strategies. They need to capture solutions. This is one of the most essential ingredients for a good pattern.</li>
					<li><strong>The solution to this problem cannot be obvious</strong>: We can find that problem-solving techniques often attempt to derive from well-known first principles. The best design patterns usually provide solutions to problems indirectly - this is considered a necessary approach for the most challenging problems related to design.</li>
					<li><strong>The concept described must have been proven</strong>: Design patterns require proof that they function as described and without this proof the design cannot be seriously considered. If a pattern is highly speculative in nature, only the brave may attempt to use it.</li>
					<li><strong>It must describe a relationship</strong>: In some cases it may appear that a pattern describes a type of module. Although an implementation may appear this way, the official description of the pattern must describe much deeper system structures and mechanisms that explain its relationship to code.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We would be forgiven for thinking that a proto-pattern which fails to meet guidelines isn't worth learning from, however, this is far from the truth. Many proto-patterns are actually quite good. I’m not saying that all proto-patterns are worth looking at, but there are quite a few useful ones in the wild that could assist us with future projects. Use best judgment with the above list in mind and you’ll be fine in your selection process.</p>

				<p>One of the additional requirements for a pattern to be valid is that they display some recurring phenomenon. This is often something that can be qualified in at least three key areas, referred to as the <em>rule of three</em>. To show recurrence using this rule, one must demonstrate:</p>

				<ol start="1" type="1">
					<li><strong>Fitness of purpose</strong> - how is the pattern considered successful?</li>
					<li><strong>Usefulness</strong> - why is the pattern considered successful?</li>
					<li><strong>Applicability</strong> - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is important to keep the above in mind.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>&hellip;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h2>Design Pattern Categor-ization</h2>

				<p>In my early experiences of learning about design patterns, I personally found the following table a very useful reminder of what a number of patterns has to offer - it covers the 23 Design Patterns mentioned by the GoF. The original table was summarized by Elyse Nielsen back in 2004 and I've modified it where necessary to suit our discussion in this section of the book.</p>

				<p>I recommend using this table as reference, but do remember that there are a number of additional patterns that are not mentioned here but will be discussed later in the book.</p>

				<h3>A brief note on classes</h3>

				<p>Keep in mind that there will be patterns in this table that reference the concept of "classes". JavaScript is a class-less language, however classes can be simulated using functions.</p>

				<p>The most common approach to achieving this is by defining a JavaScript function where we then create an object using the <code>new</code> keyword. <code>this</code> can be used to help define new properties and methods for the object as follows:</p>

				<pre><code data-language="javascript">
// A car "class"
function Car( model ) {

  this.model = model;
  this.color = "silver";
  this.year  = "2012";

  this.getInfo = function () {
	return this.model + " " + this.year;
  };

}</code></pre>

				<p>We can then instantiate the object using the Car constructor we defined above like this:</p>

				<pre><code data-language="javascript">
var myCar = new Car("ford");

myCar.year = "2010";

console.log( myCar.getInfo() );</code></pre>

				<p>For more ways to define "classes" using JavaScript, see Stoyan Stefanov's useful <a href="http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/">post</a> on them.</p>

				<p>Let us now proceed to review the table.</p>

				<p>The Observer pattern is useful for decoupling a number of different scenarios in application design and if you haven't been using it, I recommend picking up one of the pre-written implementations mentioned today and just giving it a try out. It's one of the easier design patterns to get started with but also one of the most powerful.</p>

				<h2>The Mediator Pattern</h2>

				<p>In the section on the Observer pattern, we were introduced to a way of channeling multiple event sources through a single object. This is also known as Publish/Subscribe or Event Aggregation. It's common for developers to think of Mediators when faced with this problem, so let's explore how they differ.</p>

				<p>The dictionary refers to a mediator as <i>a neutral party that assists in negotiations and conflict resolution</i>. In our world, a mediator is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to expose a unified interface through which the different parts of a system may communicate.</p>

				<figure class="figure">

					<figcaption>Yost No. 4 Typewriter</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If it appears a system has too many direct relationships between components, it may be time to have a central point of control that components communicate through instead. The Mediator promotes loose coupling by ensuring that instead of components referring to each other explicitly, their interaction is handled through this central point. This can help us decouple systems and improve the potential for component reusability.</p>

				<p>A real-world analogy could be a typical airport traffic control system. A tower (Mediator) handles what planes can take off and land because all communications (notifications being listened out for or broadcast) are done from the planes to the control tower, rather than from plane-to-plane. A centralized controller is key to the success of this system and that's really the role a Mediator plays in software design.</p>

				<figure class="figure">
					<img src="img/03.png" width="100%"></img>
					<figcaption>Caligraph Typewriter Model No. 4</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Another analogy would be DOM event bubbling and event delegation. If all subscriptions in a system are made against the document rather than individual nodes, the document effectively serves as a Mediator. Instead of binding to the events of the individual nodes, a higher level object is given the responsibility of notifying subscribers about interaction events.</p>

				<p>When it comes to the Mediator and Event Aggregator patterns, there are some times where it may look like the patterns are interchangeable due to implementation similarities. However, the semantics and intent of these patterns are very different.</p>

				<p>And even if the implementations both use some of the same core constructs, I believe there is a distinct difference between them. I also believe they should not be interchanged or confused in communication because of the differences.</p>

				<p><strong>A Simple Mediator</strong></p>

				<p>A Mediator is an object that coordinates interactions (logic and behavior) between multiple objects. It makes decisions on when to call which objects, based on the actions (or inaction) of other objects and input.</p>
